              I studied both theatre and computer science in college. After
              pursuing theatre for a while, developing leadership and
              communication skills, I couldnâ€™t turn away from my passion for
              coding. I rediscovered my love of it through self-study, then
              attended the Grace Hopper program to refine my skills. I love
              puzzling problems, building apps, and writing code. In my ideal
              role, I will have room to grow and plenty of learning
              opportunities. My goal is to use my technical abilities to make a
              positive impact.

              When I'm not coding, I'm trying to find the tastiest desserts and
              New York City's best chocolate chip cookie. Ask for
              recommendations. Be warned: I can talk about food and dessert at
              length.

            </div>
            <div>
              For this app, I focused on a mobile-compatible design. I also
              implemented authentication routes, creating different permissions
              for different user types.

              For this app, which is meant to be soothing in times of stress, I

            <h2>Surprise Me!</h2>
            <div>
              Surprise Me! is the best way to surprise your friends and family
              with gifts they actually want. You can share your wishlist with
              others and they can all pick out gifts for you with no overlap,
              but you'll never know what you're going to get.
            </div>
            <div>
              To enable the crucial functionality of this app - the prevention
              of gift overlap - I leveraged sockets and Firebase Realtime
              Database, so the webapp would update with the database in real
              time. I also utilized a NoSQL database.

            <div>
              This mobile game app lets players go on a scavenger hunts,
              determining where to go by answering riddles. Users can either see
              where they stand on a map or see the AR view through their camera

              I led backend operations for this app, as well as made significant

            <div>
              I played a pivotal role in modeling the backend data and designing
